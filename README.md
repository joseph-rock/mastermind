## Mastermind

Dusting off an old project to try out [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a python package and project manager inspired by [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) is a code-breaking game where a player guesses a secret combination of colored pegs. To get started, simply:

```
uv run mastermind.py
```

Python venv stuff (for my own sanity):

```
source .venv/bin/activate

deactivate
```
